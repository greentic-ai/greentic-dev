# Developer Guide: Building a Component Locally

This guide walks through building a full component, packaging it, and running it locally with the greentic dev mocks.

## 1. Scaffold a component

```bash
cargo xtask new-component my-component
cd component-my-component
```

The scaffold includes schema, docs, example flow, tests, and CI.

## 2. Define the schema

Edit `schemas/v1/my-component.node.schema.json` to describe configuration and defaults. Run the schema validation test:

```bash
cargo test
```

Update `docs/config.md` with supported fields and defaults.

## 3. Implement describe()

In `src/describe.rs`, populate the schema and other metadata returned to the runner. Should reference the published schema URL. Use `src/lib.rs` to expose crate interface.

## 4. Build the component binary/pack

Implement the component logic (WASM pack or native). Provide a `describe` command and operation handlers.

## 5. Run unit tests

Add component-specific tests in `tests/` and run with optional golden regeneration:

```bash
GOLDEN_ACCEPT=1 cargo test      # when updating goldens
cargo test                      # ensure clean run
```

## 6. Package for local deployment

If producing a pack, use the standard greentic pack tooling (`greentic-pack build`). Otherwise build the binary.

## 7. Validate flows locally

Back in the greentic-dev workspace, create/update flows referencing the new component schema or pack.

Validate with the dev runner:

```bash
cargo run -p greentic-dev -- run -f examples/flows/my-component.yaml --validate-only
```

This generates a transcript at `.greentic/transcripts`.

## 8. Run with mocks

Ensure the mocks are configured (see `docs/mocks.md`). Start the dev runner without `--validate-only` (execution support is under development) and use transcripts to verify defaults vs overrides (`cargo run -p dev-viewer -- --file <transcript>`).

## 9. CI readiness

Commit schema, docs, and tests. Ensure `cargo fmt`, `cargo clippy`, and `cargo test` pass. Update CI workflows if required.

## 10. Publish docs and schema

Deploy the schema to GitHub Pages (or the configured CDN). Update documentation (`docs/`) so developers understand usage, testing, CI, and security requirements.
