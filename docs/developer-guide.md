# Developer Guide: End-to-End Hello World Component

This guide walks from a clean workstation all the way to a “hello world” Greentic component that you can validate locally. Follow the steps in order; each section calls out the exact commands you need to run.

---

## 1. Prerequisites

1. **Install Rust (via rustup).**
   ```bash
   curl https://sh.rustup.rs -sSf | sh
   source "$HOME/.cargo/env"
   rustup update stable
   ```

2. **Add the WASI target required by `cargo component`.**
   ```bash
   rustup target add wasm32-wasip2
   ```

3. **Install component tooling.**
   ```bash
   cargo install cargo-component --locked
   ```
   > `cargo-component` performs the WIT-driven build; install it once and keep it updated with `cargo install cargo-component --locked --force`.

4. **(Optional) Install supporting CLI tools.**
   - `cargo install wasm-tools --locked` if you want to inspect component metadata with `wasm-tools component wit`.
   - `cargo install just` if you prefer using the repo’s shorthand tasks.

5. **(Optional) Install `greentic-dev` globally.**
   ```bash
   cargo install greentic-dev
   ```
   For the latest commit or local forks:
   ```bash
   cargo install --git https://github.com/greentic-ai/greentic-dev greentic-dev
   # or from the current checkout
   cargo install --path .
   ```
   Installing the CLI lets you run `greentic-dev component …` without prefixing commands with `cargo run -p`.

> For most workflows (including this guide) you only need the installed CLI. Clone the `greentic-dev` repository only if you intend to contribute code or work on the tooling itself.

---

## 2. Scaffold a hello world component

Use the `greentic-dev` CLI to generate a new component skeleton. This populates a ready-to-build WASM package, provider metadata, schema, and docs.

```bash
greentic-dev component new hello-world
cd component-hello-world
```

> Running directly from the repo? Use `cargo run -p greentic-dev -- component new hello-world`.

The scaffold contains:

| Path | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| `Cargo.toml` | Component manifest (wired for `cargo component`). |
| `provider.toml` | Canonical metadata that drives packaging + validation. |
| `schemas/v1/config.schema.json` | JSON Schema for node configuration. |
| `src/lib.rs` | The component implementation (starts with an echo example wired to guest imports). |
| `README.md` | Mini playbook that you can expand for this specific component. |

Open `src/lib.rs` and confirm the stub echoes the `message` field back to the caller—that is our “hello world”.

---

## 3. Build the component

From inside the component directory:

```bash
cargo component build --release --target wasm32-wasip2
```

This emits `target/wasm32-wasip2/release/hello-world.wasm` using the published `greentic-interfaces-guest` bindings—no vendored WIT required.

If you ever see a network-related error, double-check that `cargo fetch` succeeded earlier. The Greentic scaffolder assumes offline builds, so the `cargo` registry cache needs to be populated once up front.

---

## 4. Validate with the greentic-dev CLI

Return to the workspace root (or pass the component path explicitly) and run the validator. It compiles (if you didn’t already), decodes the embedded WIT packages, and checks your metadata.

```bash
greentic-dev component validate --path component-hello-world
```

You should see output similar to:

```
✓ Validated hello-world 0.1.0
  artifact: .../component-hello-world/target/wasm32-wasip2/release/hello-world.wasm
  sha256 : <hash>
  world  : greentic:component/component@0.4.0
  packages:
    - greentic:component@0.4.0
    - greentic:secrets@1.0.0
    - greentic:state@1.0.0
    - greentic:http@1.0.0
    - greentic:telemetry@1.0.0
    ...
  exports: <skipped - missing WASI host support>
```

> The final line is expected today: local WASI Preview 2 host shims may be missing. Validation still succeeds; only the manifest inspection is skipped.

If validation fails, fix the reported issue (wrong version pins, missing artifact, etc.) and re-run the command.

---

## 5. (Optional) Package the component

When you are ready to distribute your build artifact, let the `pack` subcommand produce a canonical bundle:

```bash
greentic-dev component pack --path component-hello-world
```

This writes:

```
component-hello-world/packs/hello-world/0.1.0/
  ├─ hello-world-0.1.0.wasm
  ├─ meta.json           # JSON rendering of provider.toml with sha256 + timestamp
  └─ SHA256SUMS
```

These files are what CI/CD or downstream integration tooling will consume.

---

## 6. Wire the component into a flow (hello world)

Create a simple flow definition that references the new component. From the workspace root:

```bash
cat <<'YAML' > examples/flows/hello-world.yaml
version: 1
nodes:
  hello:
    using: hello-world
    config:
      message: "Hello from Greentic!"
YAML
```

Run the flow validator to ensure the flow and schema line up:

```bash
greentic-dev flow validate -f examples/flows/hello-world.yaml --json
```

> Prefer running straight from the workspace? Use `cargo run -p greentic-dev -- flow …` instead.

Successful validation produces canonical JSON you can feed into review tools. When you are ready to execute the full pack, run `greentic-dev pack build …` followed by `greentic-dev pack run …` to generate transcripts under `.greentic/runs/`.

---

## 7. Next steps: iterate on the component

With the skeleton in place you can now:

1. **Customize behavior.** Edit `src/lib.rs` to perform real work instead of echoing input. Pull in additional guest modules from `greentic-interfaces-guest` if your component needs other Greentic interfaces.
2. **Expand the schema.** Update `schemas/v1/config.schema.json` with required fields, defaults, and examples.
3. **Document configuration and testing.** Extend `README.md` (scaffolded in the component) so other developers know how to run and validate it.
4. **Add tests.** Bring in `cargo test` suites or golden tests. The Greentic toolchain honors `GOLDEN_ACCEPT=1` for regeneration, the same as other repos.
5. **Keep linting clean.** In the component folder run `cargo fmt`, `cargo clippy --all-targets -- -D warnings`, and `cargo test` before committing.

Once the component is ready, integrate it into CI using the guidance in `docs/scaffolder.md` and `docs/runner.md`, and publish schemas/docs through the usual GitHub Pages workflow.

## Quick reference

```
# one-time setup
rustup target add wasm32-wasip2
cargo install cargo-component --locked

# scaffold
greentic-dev component new hello-world
cd component-hello-world

# develop
cargo component build --release --target wasm32-wasip2
greentic-dev component validate --path .
greentic-dev component pack --path .      # optional
```

You now have a fully reproducible path from a fresh machine to a validated Greentic component. Happy building!
