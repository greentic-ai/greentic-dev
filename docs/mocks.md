# Local Mocks

The `dev-runner` crate ships with lightweight mocks so flows can be exercised without talking to real infrastructure.

## Ports and endpoints

* **HTTP mocks** – Default to `127.0.0.1:3100`. Override via the `MOCK_HTTP_PORT` environment variable.
* **NATS mock** – Starts on `127.0.0.1:4223`. Override via `MOCK_NATS_PORT`.
* **Secret vault mock** – Binds to `127.0.0.1:8201` with an in-memory backend.

Mocks only listen on loopback and are started on demand by the runner.

## Fault injection

Use environment variables or flow metadata to enable specific failure modes:

| Mock           | Env var                    | Behaviour                                 |
| -------------- | -------------------------- | ----------------------------------------- |
| HTTP           | `MOCK_HTTP_FAIL_PATTERN`   | Regex of paths to force 500 responses.    |
| NATS           | `MOCK_NATS_DROP_RATE`      | Fraction (0–1) of messages to drop.       |
| Secret vault   | `MOCK_VAULT_SEAL_AT_START` | When set, mock starts in sealed state.    |

These knobs let you confirm your flow handles partial failures, retries, and transient outages before deploying.
