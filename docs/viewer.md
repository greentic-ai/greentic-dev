# Transcript Viewer

The `dev-viewer` binary renders flow transcripts generated by the validator.

## Defaults vs overrides

Every node in a transcript includes a `run_log` describing how the final configuration was built:

* `default: inputs.client_secret` – value came from component defaults.
* `override: inputs.client_id` – value was supplied in the flow.

When viewing a transcript, the CLI highlights these distinctions:

```text
inputs:
  client_id: abc (override)
  client_secret: null (default)
```

Use the viewer to quickly see which fields still rely on defaults and which have been customised.
